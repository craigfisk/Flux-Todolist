# Update for React 0.14.7
Craig Fisk, 2016-2-4

Added an .eslintrc and per .eslintrc in Atom added semicolons and changed " to ', removed getDOMNode() twice (before "value") in app/components/AddItem.js, in app/App.js
replaced React.render with ReactDOM.render (and required it), and also upgraded to later versions of tools in package.json (note: webpack on my system is globally installed latest version, webpack@2.1.0-beta.4, but probably doesn't matter).

This is a basic environment for learning React and Flux with debugger; statements in the code and breaking in Chrome Dev Tools to examine values in the debug console.
